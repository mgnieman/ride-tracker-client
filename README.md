User stories:
- As a signed-in user, I want to add/create a ride to my list of rides - including [date, distance, time, avg. speed] so that I can track my cycling progress.
- As a signed-in user, I want to view my full list of rides so that I can see if I've gotten faster over over time.
- As a signed-in user, I want to be able to edit/update a ride - either [date, distance, time, or avg. speed] so that I can fix an error with one or two fields.
- As a signed-in user, I want to delete a ride so that I can fix a row that is completely wrong and re-enter the info later.

Technologies Used:  JavaScript, jQuery, API, AJAX

Future Enhancements:
-

10.20
- Worked on authorization - sign up gave me a lot of trouble but eventually got help figuring out that I needed a function for `addHandlers` in `index.js`.  It's 4:24pm and I finally have sign-up, sign-in, change-password & sign-out all working correctly.

10.22
- Add buttons - "Add Ride" & "Clear Ride" and initial setup for handlebars.

10.23
- Added a form to add ride info (date, distance & duration)
