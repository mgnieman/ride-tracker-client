User stories:
- As a signed-in user, I want to add/create a ride to my list of rides - including [date, distance, time, avg. speed] so that I can track my cycling progress.
- As a signed-in user, I want to view my full list of rides so that I can see if I've gotten faster over over time.
- As a signed-in user, I want to be able to edit/update a ride - either [date, distance, time, or avg. speed] so that I can fix an error with one or two fields.
- As a signed-in user, I want to delete a ride so that I can fix a row that is completely wrong and re-enter the info later.

Technologies Used:  JavaScript, jQuery, API, AJAX

Future Enhancements:
- 

10.20
